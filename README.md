# Balance-UCSD-VPL
 
This dataset contains 11028 3D body landmark sequences and corresponding center of pressure measurements for balance-related movement video clips. Each video clip contains 120 frames of 3D body landmark and its corresponding center of pressure position.

This dataset includes data from 21 healthy adults. During the collection phase, each subject stood on the force plate with no shoes using 1) feet side-by-side and 2) feet-in-tandem (i.e., heel to toe) posutres. We instructed subjects to perform random movements, e.g., from rigid standing to body swaying involing the trunk, arms, hands, or bending knees. The only specified requirement was not to move the feet; we provided no specific instructions about the action patterns.

The video was collected by two calibrated RGB cameras using a resolution of 640 x 480 pixels at 30 fps, while the center of pressure was recorded at 60 Hz using a force plate. Please refer to the following publications for more details.
